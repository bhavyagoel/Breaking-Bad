># NEED OF THIS PROJECT

#### This project consists of a video conferencing app, a speech to text app as well as speech to sigh language. As we know that due to the digitalization of education, corporate, etc online conferencing is the best way to communicate. But, specially-abled people who cannot speak or listen...communication with and for them has become difficult. 

># OVERVIEW OF CREATION OF THIS PROJECT

###### We have created a real-time web-app that uses socket.io for communication and also speech recognition API for speech to text. We have then taken that text and converted it into sign language. For this, we have used simple plain vanilla js with some ES6 functions. The speech to text transformation will be reflected on both sides i.e. listerener's as well as speaker's side.
